# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Note rendering moved into a frontend-independent `render` module that emits a
  structured model (`NoteUnit`: sentence-split prose or verbatim code blocks);
  the TUI now only paints it. No change to how notes look — this lets a future
  frontend reuse the same note structuring instead of reimplementing it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

First release of `flash`: a terminal spaced-repetition flashcard trainer with
a ratatui TUI, plain-text decks, two schedulers, several answer modes, cloze
cards, deck dependencies, an ask-Claude helper, and AI deck generation.

### Deck format
- Plain text: `#` card front at column 0, indented answer lines, `! ` notes
  (multiple `!` lines form one multi-line note), `% ` comments, `\` to escape
  a leading markup character. Indented `#` lines are answer content, not new
  cards.
- **Cloze cards**: a `#?` front with `{holes}` in the answer expands into one
  sub-card per hole; sibling holes are masked and spaced apart in the queue.
- **Directives** (`% key: value`): `mode`, `order`, `scheduler` set per-deck
  defaults; read from the requested deck(s) only, overridden by CLI flags.
- **Dependencies** (`% requires: <deck>`): prerequisite decks are pulled in
  transitively and ordered foundations-first; cycles and missing prerequisites
  are reported. Prerequisites contribute cards only, not directives.
- **Reference links** (`% link: <url>`) are offered to the ask-Claude feature.

### Review
- Answer modes: **flip** (default, self-graded), **typing** (char-by-char),
  **fuzzy** (whole-line, typo-tolerant), **choice** (multiple choice with
  distractors sampled from the session), and **line** (reveal the back one
  line at a time — for lyrics, poems, ordered lists).
- Schedulers: **Leitner** (the original 6-stage boxes, compatibility-verified)
  and **SM-2** (per-card ease factors), interchangeable.
- Session controls: `--new` (new-card cap), `--limit`, `--cram`,
  `--order sequential`, restart from the summary screen, failed cards requeued
  within the run.
- Notes render as a quoted block, split into sentences, with fenced code shown
  verbatim (indentation preserved).

### Ask Claude
- Press `?` on an answered card to ask the Claude Code CLI about it without
  leaving the session; one conversation spans the run. `Ctrl-N` condenses the
  exchange into note lines appended to the deck. The input line supports cursor
  movement and editing. Runs headless with a safe permission model (`dontAsk`
  + an exclusive `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` allowlist).

### AI deck generation
- `flash generate <url>` builds a deck from a web page via Claude (WebFetch),
  with a prompt that spreads cards across four layers of understanding, uses
  cloze and notes, and self-reviews for redundancy; `--review` adds a second
  refinement pass. Output is validated and saved (or `--print`ed); `--cards`
  and `[generate]` config tune it. Claude only returns text — flash writes the
  file — so no extra tool permissions are needed.

### Other commands
- `flash browse` — read-only walk through cards (no grading, no writes).
- `flash deps` (alias `require`) — edit a deck's prerequisites with a checkbox
  picker.
- `flash stats`, `flash list`, `flash check`, `flash config`.
- Startup **deck picker** (recent decks + the decks directory) when run with no
  arguments.

### Configuration
- `~/.config/flash/config.toml` with `[keys]`, `[browse]`, `[ask]`,
  `[generate]` sections and `decks_dir`. `flash config --init` writes a
  self-documenting template (every option commented at its default);
  `flash config` prints the active settings. Key bindings are rebindable.

### Storage
- Card identity is a stable XxHash64 over the deck file name plus the back
  lines (a test pins the value so upgrades never orphan progress). Progress is
  stored at `~/.local/share/flash/progress.json`, created on first use.

### Desktop
- `assets/install-desktop.sh` installs an icon, launcher, and `.desktop` entry.
